## Reporting an Issue

To report an issue, or to suggest an idea for a change, open an [issue](../../issues/new). It is best to check our existing [issues](../../issues) first to see if a similar one has already been opened and discussed.
## Getting Feedback on Your Contribution

When creating a PR for one of our projects it is important to get your work reviewed by other members of the team. Below are some steps to getting your work reviewed. <br>
* Assign a Reviewer from the list of reviewers on the project.
* Change the status of the issue from `In Progress` to `Ready For Review` on the [Project Codeflare Sprint Board](https://github.com/orgs/project-codeflare/projects/8/views/3).
* Once the PR is reviewed the reviewer may request changes to be made, or if they are happy with the PR they will apply an `lgtm` label.
* You can now change the status of the issue to `In Review`.
* When the `lgtm` label has been applied you can assign an Approver to your PR.
* The approver may request more changes, or if they are happy with the PR they will apply the `approved` label. After this the PR will be merged.
* You can now change the status of the issue to `Closed` if the status didn't change automatically after the merge.
